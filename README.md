What if instead of ____ we do ____ etc and etc and etc. So I decided to learn a bit of neuroscience and come up with some ideas on how to make the next generation of ANN. I would love to hear on how I can improve on my code or add new things/concepts to the ANN.

As it stands now though, the following concepts are supposed to be implemented into the code:

# chemical massangers
# multiple or singular puleses
# normal valve opening based on "ions"
# free energy pinciple ( high level )

# Integrators: respond based on cumulative input strength.
#      Bistable integrators (saddle-node): can rest or fire persistently depending on history.
#      Monostable integrators (SNIC): fire only when input eliminates rest via bifurcation.
#
# Resonators: sensitive to input timing and rhythms.
#      Supercritical Hopf: oscillate in response to rhythmic input.
#      Subcritical Hopf: bistable oscillators responding to precise timing


Some YouTube videos that basically made me come up with the above mentioned ideas:
